                        Hello again! So... you want to know things about me, right? Well...
                        <br />
                        I'm a student that loves coding, writing, and overall anything that involves creativity and technology. I'm a member of <a href="https://hackclub.com" className={`${basecolor} hover:underline`}>Hack Club</a>, and I spend most of my day (gotta sleep, study and eat, so not the whole day {myexpression}) working on... Well, depends on the day XD.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        As for my setup, I have a <span className={`${basecolor}`}>Pixel 9 Pro XL</span> as my daily driver phone, a <span className={`${basecolor}`}>Macbook Air 13" (M2, 2024)</span> as my main PC and a <span className={`${basecolor}`}>Raspberry Pi 5</span> as my server/NAS.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        The main apps I use... well, we've got <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" className={`${basecolor} hover:underline`}>VS Code</a> for all my programming, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" className={`${basecolor} hover:underline`}>Obsidian</a> for my notes (primarily for my animated series), <a href="https://www.figma.com/" className={`${basecolor} hover:underline`}>Figma</a> for design, and <a href="https://slack.com/" className={`${basecolor} hover:underline`}>Slack</a> and <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/" className={`${basecolor} hover:underline`}>WhatsApp</a> (yeah, sadly I need to use it to communicate with close people) for communication.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        And what else can I say? Uh... I use JS for 99% of the things I do :3 (JS supremacy lets gooooo), love nice UI/UX design (yeah, I'm always following the latest design trends), and I'm always looking for new projects to work on! Have ideas? Let me know! Not on email though, the challenge is to find me on Slack or Discord.
