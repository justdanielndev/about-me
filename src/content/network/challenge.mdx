This year my team and I participated in [The Challenge](https://educaixa.org/es/landing-thechallenge), a competition aimed at creating projects that helped fulfill the purposes of the SDGs. Our project, SoundChestAI, was a digital phonendoscope that used AI to help detect possible illnesses in the respiratory system by analyzing sounds with a custom AI model built by me.

We were able to arrive to Barcelona (selected out of 3000+ participants) and present our project! It was a very nice experience to showcase our work, and we got to know lots of people that loved our project and encouraged us to keep improving the world.

Quite an amazing experience!
