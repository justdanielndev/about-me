Last year I participated (and won!) [GoCalp](https://www.go2ods.net/), a competition organised by Global Omnium that was designed to promote the SDGs (I... think I might participate in waaaay to many competitions related to those XD). The best 2 projects competed in Calpe, and my project was awarded first price! I loved presenting my work in front of so many important people :D.
