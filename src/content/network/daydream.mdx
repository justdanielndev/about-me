This year I had the pleasure of organising [Daydream Valencia](https://valencia.daydream.hackclub.com/), the largest Game Jam ever for students under 18 in Spain. It was an amazing experience working with Hack Club and our team to create a fun environment, and all the projects were amazing!

Everyone had an incredible time, and I was so happy to see the creativity and talent of all the participants. We had a lot of fun, and got sponsors like Yubico, AVAST, Hack Club (of couse, they were co-organizers after all).

I hope to organise more events like this in the future (who knows, maybe a "mediathon" with Nix Entertainment?).
