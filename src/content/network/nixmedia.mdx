Nix Media is a media (animation, games and other categories) group I created with my closest friends. Our mission is to create entertainment in new ways, to help make the world fun again.

Our first and current animated series is Shadowborne Chronicles. Its story goes around Umbriel and Aria, two... friends? maybe we could call it that... that unexpectedly meet, and go on a journey to fight against Zarka, the leader of the Shadow Lieutenants and main antagonist of Season 1. Across their journey they'll discover more about themselves, about their world and about their past, and maybe even learn to accept each other.

We're working on Season 1 at the moment, and once the series is finished, we have some more ideas we'll work on! Stay tuned!
