Well... Let's see what is the best way to approach this topic. I know it's something controversial for some, and also a really hot topic, so... let me see.

First of all, AI and coding. I think AI can be really useful to improve speed for _already experienced developers_. It can help with repetitive tasks, fixing typos and bugs that you left behind... But if you don't know how to code, "vibe coding" the entire codebase is going to do nothing in your favor. You're not learning, whatever you're building is probably going to look quite bad and generic, and you're not going to be able to fix any issues that appear throughout your journey.

I don't mind you using AI to, I don't know, create a tiny basic boilerplate that you can later build on top of, but, even if you're an experienced developer, don't use it to build the whole thing.

Now, image generation. I personally hate the idea of companies and people using AI as a replacement for human creativity. I understand the appeal of free, fast, and easy image/video generation, but it's not worth it. AI-generated images lack consistency, constantly copy styles from others, contain a lot of issues and just makes everything feel generic.

In the past 2 years every person I know (including myself) now has to go around thinking "is this image/video AI generated?" and it's kind of sad. Lots of artists have had to change their art style just because people thought it was too "AI-like", and I believe it's very unfair.

But I do say that AI is quite cool for some use cases. For example, I use Claude as my personal assistant. We chit-chat from time to time, talk about a variety of everyday life topics... And it's nice! It doesn't harm anyone, it helps me organize my thoughts, and makes my life overall better! So, AI itself isn't "bad", so long as you're using it properly, _disclosing its use when it's there_, and not using it to replace humans.

I'll update this post in the future depending on what happens or if there's anything else to say (you'll know it's been updated as I'll change the date to reflect the latest update), but for now, this is my view on AI. I hope you enjoyed reading it, and if you have any thoughts, feel free to share them with me! :D
